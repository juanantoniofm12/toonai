## The project

Integrate Toon™ and API AI™ Together, so I can ask the toon to do stuff in my
house with it.

## Step 1. The API agent

## Step 2. The Toon API Account

## Step 3. The API AI - Toon Integration API

To translate between the api webhook and the toon.
Implemented in Zaap, a python boilerplate project, to run flask in AWS lambdas.

It will implement a call for each posible action with the toon.
It will be fed all the credentials required to authenticate with the toon.
The bearer code and secret will be passed as HTTP headers.
This can later on be sent to quby for further improvement, I imagine it will 
look like a piece of hell XXDD
