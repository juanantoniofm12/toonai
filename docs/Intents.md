# Intents

Intents are the efforts that the api ai agent will do to translate voice to
commands that you can fulfill. 

From the intent, a webhook will be called, which will fulfill the action
desired by the user.

## Turn On heating

 Not sure if this one is possible yet. The idea is just to turn the heating on, 
by setting it to comfort, or to put it on 24 degrees or something.

## What is the temperature of my house

 Maybe this one is easier to create in the 1st place, as is clearly provided
 by the toon api, and is less harmfull in case of a mistake.

Some sentences:

- how hot is the house
- how warm is the living room
- what is the temperature at my place
- what is the house temperature
