# Basic Privacy Policy

At a minimum, your privacy policy should answer the three questions below:

## What information do you collect?

 None (from the user). I collect some logs of the http requests, but they hold no personal data.
 
 ## How do you use the information?
 
 I do not collect. Therefore I do not have a use for it.
 
 ## What information do you share
 
 I can share access logs in case you are interested, but no personal data, or tracking of any kind is done.
